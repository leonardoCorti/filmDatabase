# filmDatabase
a simple gui application to create a small film database to keep track of the films you watched and have some data

WIP!

I'm using OMDb, to use this app you will need an API key, it's free 

The "database" is a .csv file so that it is readable without this program

the visualization of the films will update only after closing and reopnening, I will work on it
